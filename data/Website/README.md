This folder contains files for VISOR's website. It should be on an open port on the router, so that it can be accessed
from any device on the network. The website is a simple static site, with no server-side processing.

EDIT: there is no website anymore - now the server is internal to VISOR and is through WebSockets. Just open port 3234
on the router and VISOR will have access to all the files here.
