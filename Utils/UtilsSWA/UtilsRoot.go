	// So the way it checks root is supposed to be the same (hopefully it's the same and I didn't mess up). Only the
	// shell part is now removed because it is on the mentioned function.
	// EDIT: it's no longer going according to the mentioned webpage. Now it just checks yes or no, not yes, no
	// because denied, or no because not rooted.

	// one (127), which for sure indicates there is no su binary available - how could it return [didn't get to
	// finish... It could return 127 for no permission... Nothing stops it from not returning 127.]
	// EDIT: I don't think there is a reliable way to check if root is available or not on the device (I don't
	// mean denied - I mean, device not rooted at all) without checking the default binary locations. I don't
	// know if that's reliable either, and so far no need to know if the user decided not to give root
	// permissions while being able to, so whatever.

	// All that is needed to know if there is root access is to know if the User ID is 0, which means root. If it's
	// not root, then permission to access it was either denied or the su binary is non-existent (device not
	// rooted).
