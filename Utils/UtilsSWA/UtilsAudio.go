/*
AdjustGainBufferAUDIO adjusts the volume of raw audio data.

Note that this function does not care about noise or anything at all - it just applies the same gain to ALL bytes. If
the gain would generate an overflow, the maximum value for the number of provided bits is used instead. If gain is 1,
this function is a no-op.

-----------------------------------------------------------

– Params:
  - audio_bytes – the audio data
  - gain – the gain to apply to the data
  - n_bits – the number of bits per sample (e.g. 16 for 16-bit PCM)

– Returns:
  - the adjusted audio data
