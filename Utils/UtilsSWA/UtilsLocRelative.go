These distances are solely to standardize values on the app.

Also the distance returned by RSSI calculations may be misleading, so this also discretizes the distances to hopefully
more precise values. For example, ABSTR_DISTANCE_1 means the devices are right next to each other. ABSTR_DISTANCE_5
means they're near. A wall or 2 away at most maybe.

	"RSSI = -10*n*log10(d)-A (4)
	In Equation 4, RSSI is the radio signal strength indicator in dBm, n is the signal propagation constant or
	exponent [, also called Path Loss Exponent, which is dimensionless], d is the relative distance between the
	communicating nodes [in meters], and A is a reference received signal strength in dBm (the RSSI value measured
	when the separation distance between the receiver and the transmitter is one meter)."

	(The formula seems to be from Texas Instruments on the CC2420 chip.)

	So getting d from there, we have this below. Should be RSSI+A, but that term is supposed to be 0 if both values
	are equal, with with a +, that won't happen, so I saw people having +A on the main formula, and then it results
	in:
	d = 10^(-(RSSI-A)/10n)

	----------------
	[Note: our n here is gamma on Wikipedia.]

	So using the Office with soft-partition at 1.9 GHz with 2.6, knowing on 900 MHz it was 2.4, and also that
	Bluetooth operates at 2.4-2.5 GHz, 2.7-2.8 seems a good choice of value at home (so 2.75 - average).
	But that's only with objects in the way. If there's a straight path, 2.1 doesn't seem a bad value (there's the
	phone or computer case). So if the distance is very small, 2.1 will be used (can't be much in the way if the
	distance is like 1 meter with 2.75 as value).
	Another possibility is the object being further away. In case, then other objects might be in its path. Then we
	rise the value, depending on the distance. For example, 5 meters or more could have stuff in the way already.
	10-20 meters and even more stuff (not counting open field here... - can't guess this kind of thing without GPS).
	Else, 2.75 will be used.


	From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_loss:
	"In the study of wireless communications, path loss can be represented by the path loss exponent, whose value
	is normally in the range of 2 to 4 (where 2 is for propagation in free space, 4 is for relatively lossy
	environments and for the case of full specular reflection from the earth surface—the so-called flat earth
	model). In some environments, such as buildings, stadiums and other indoor environments, the path loss exponent
	can reach values in the range of 4 to 6. On the other hand, a tunnel may act as a waveguide, resulting in a path
	loss exponent less than 2."

	So, 5 meters or more, could be 2.75 + (4+6)/2 = 3.875 = 3.88. For more than 20 meters, why not 6.0. On more than
	50 meters, I'll use 8.0. A person said n could reach from 2 to 8 in some cases. So I'll use that 8 value here.

GetAveragePingRttLOCRELATIVE gets the average round-trip time (RTT) between the current device and the specified IP

This function pings the specified IP address 50 times, eliminates outlier time values, and finally calculates the
average of the resulting values (the round-trip time, RTT).

ATTENTION: this function takes about a minute to return!

It can also return awful results (like 200m when it's in fact 3-4m). That's because it depends on many factors, not
just the speed of light (it doesn't only measure the time between the transmitter and the receptor - electronics delays
are included, and other things).

Though it can too return decent results, like 3-4m when it's 3-4m indeed. But the nonsense cases must be filtered out.
