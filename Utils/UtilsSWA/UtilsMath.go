/*
IsOutlierMATH checks if an element is an outlier of an array.

The functions does so by checking if the elements is inside a range of mean +- X * standard deviation.

-----------------------------------------------------------

– Params:
  - value – the element to check
  - sum – the sum of all the elements
  - sum_squares – the sum of the squares of all the elements
  - n – the number of elements
  - accuracy_parameter – the mentioned X value

– Returns:
  - true if it's an outlier, false otherwise
